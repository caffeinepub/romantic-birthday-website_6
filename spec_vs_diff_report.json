  "summary": "The diff modifies FloatingHearts.tsx to address REQ-11. The implementation increases heart count to 40 (within the 30–45 range), raises opacity to 0.55–0.90 (high enough to be visible), distributes hearts across full viewport using percentage-based top positioning (0–110%), uses negative delays for immediate visibility, and preserves the `visible` prop for blackout state hiding. All changes are confined to FloatingHearts.tsx with no other components modified.",
