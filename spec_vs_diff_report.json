  "summary": "The diff modifies the three animation components (FloatingHearts, FlowerRain, BalloonAnimation) to reference new image asset paths for heart, flower, and balloon graphics. The components now point to /assets/generated/heart-graphic.dim_120x120.png, /assets/generated/flower-graphic.dim_120x120.png, and /assets/generated/balloon-graphic.dim_80x140.png respectively. All animation logic, parameters, counts, z-index, placement, and distribution logic appear unchanged in the component code. However, the actual image asset files themselves are not present in the diff — no new image files were added.",
