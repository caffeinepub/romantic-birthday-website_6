# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing heart, flower, and balloon visual assets with high-quality, clearly recognizable graphics in the Romantic Birthday app.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current heart graphic used in the FloatingHearts component with a new high-quality heart image asset (heart-graphic.png)
- Replace the current flower graphic used in the FlowerRain component with a new high-quality flower image asset (flower-graphic.png)
- Replace the current balloon graphic used in the BalloonAnimation component with a new high-quality balloon image asset (balloon-graphic.png)
- All animation properties, logic, layout, colors, and component behavior remain completely unchanged

**User-visible outcome:** The floating hearts, falling flowers, and flying balloons now display sharp, premium, clearly recognizable graphics instead of the previous visuals, while all animations and app behavior remain identical.
