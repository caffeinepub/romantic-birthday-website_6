# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make floating hearts more visible and evenly distributed across the full viewport when the pink theme is active.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the base opacity of hearts in the FloatingHearts component so they are clearly noticeable against the pink background.
- Ensure hearts are distributed across the full width and height of the viewport instead of being clustered in one area.
- Set the heart count to a moderate range of 30–45.
- Keep hearts hidden during the blackout/black screen state (no change to that behavior).

**User-visible outcome:** When the pink theme is active, floating hearts are prominently visible and spread evenly across the entire screen — noticeable but not overwhelming.
