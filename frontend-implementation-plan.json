Adjust the heart count to a moderate range (30–45) if currently at 45, keep it; otherwise adjust to this range. Enhance the randomization logic for positioning to ensure hearts are distributed across the full viewport width and height, not clustered in one area. Update opacity values in the style generation to be higher (e.g., minimum 0.4–0.5 instead of lower values) so hearts are clearly noticeable. Ensure the generated image frontend/public/assets/generated/heart-float.dim_64x64.png is used as the heart image source. Do not change the visibility prop logic or blackout state behavior."
